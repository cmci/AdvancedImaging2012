@article{Cheezum2001a,
abstract = {Single particle tracking has seen numerous applications in biophysics, ranging from the diffusion of proteins in cell membranes to the movement of molecular motors. A plethora of computer algorithms have been developed to monitor the sub-pixel displacement of fluorescent objects between successive video frames, and some have been claimed to have "nanometer" resolution. To date, there has been no rigorous comparison of these algorithms under realistic conditions. In this paper, we quantitatively compare specific implementations of four commonly used tracking algorithms: cross-correlation, sum-absolute difference, centroid, and direct Gaussian fit. Images of fluorescent objects ranging in size from point sources to 5 microm were computer generated with known sub-pixel displacements. Realistic noise was added and the above four algorithms were compared for accuracy and precision. We found that cross-correlation is the most accurate algorithm for large particles. However, for point sources, direct Gaussian fit to the intensity distribution is the superior algorithm in terms of both accuracy and precision, and is the most robust at low signal-to-noise. Most significantly, all four algorithms fail as the signal-to-noise ratio approaches 4. We judge direct Gaussian fit to be the best algorithm when tracking single fluorophores, where the signal-to-noise is frequently near 4.},

@article{Grabher2007,
abstract = {Macrophages detecting and migrating toward sites of injury and infection represent one of the first steps in an immune response. Here we directly image macrophage birth and migration in vivo in transgenic medaka fish. Macrophages are born as frequently dividing, immotile cells with spherical morphology that differentiate into flat, highly motile cells. They retain mitotic activity while spreading over the entire body. Cells follow restricted paths not only in directed migration, but also during patrolling. Along those paths the macrophages rapidly patrol the tissue and respond to wounding and bacterial infection from long distances. Upon injury they increase their speed and migratory persistence. Specifically targeting PI3-kinase isoforms efficiently blocks the wounding response and results in a distinct inhibition of cell motility and chemotaxis. Our study provides in situ insights into the properties of immature and migratory macrophages and presents a unique model to further test modulating compounds in vivo.},

High-throughput 2D fluorescent imaging platforms are now in wide use and are being applied on a proteome wide scale. Multiple fluorophore 3D imaging of live cells is being used to give detailed localization and subcellular structure information. Further, 2D and 3D video microscopy are giving important insights into the dynamics of protein localization and transport. In parallel with these developments, significant research has gone into developing new methodologies for quantifying and extracting meaning from the imaging data. Here we outline and give entry points to the literature on approaches to quantification such as segmentation, tracking, automated classification and data visualization. Particular attention is paid to the distinction between and application of concrete quantification measures such as number of objects in a cell, and abstract measures such as texture.},

@article{Jaqaman2009a,
abstract = {Obtaining quantitative data from live cell images is the key to testing mechanistic hypotheses of molecular and cellular processes. The importance of using computer vision-based methods to accomplish this task is well recognized. However, in practice, investigators often encounter obstacles that render the application of computational image processing in cell biology far from routine. First, it is not always clear which measurements are necessary to characterize a molecular system and whether these measurements are sufficient to characterize the cellular process under investigation. Second, even when the requirements for measurements are well defined, it often is difficult to find a software tool to extract these data. It can be even more challenging to find software tools to answer specific questions raised by the hypotheses underlying the experiments. One solution is for investigators to develop their own software tools. This is feasible for some applications with the assistance of commercial and open-source software packages that support the assembly and integration of custom-designed algorithms, even for users with limited computational expertise. Another solution is for investigators to develop interdisciplinary collaborations with computer scientists. Such collaborations require close interaction between the computer scientists and experimental biologists to optimize the data acquisition and analytical procedures, which must be tightly coupled in any project applying computational analysis to biological image data. This article introduces the basic concepts that make the application of computational image processing to live cell image data successful.},

abstract = {Recording light-microscopy images of large, nontransparent specimens, such as developing multicellular organisms, is complicated by decreased contrast resulting from light scattering. Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy (DSLM-SI) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. DSLM-SI provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila DSLM-SI data and created a fly digital embryo.},

We developed digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy and recorded nuclei localization and movement in entire wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos over the first 24 hours of development. Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides "digital embryos," that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource.},

abstract = {Achieving complete understanding of any living thing inevitably requires thorough analysis of both its anatomic and dynamic properties. Live-cell imaging experiments carried out to this end often produce massive amounts of time-lapse image data containing far more information than can be digested by a human observer. Computerized image analysis offers the potential to take full advantage of available data in an efficient and reproducible manner. A recurring task in many experiments is the tracking of large numbers of cells or particles and the analysis of their (morpho)dynamic behavior. In the past decade, many methods have been developed for this purpose, and software tools based on these are increasingly becoming available. Here, we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the various computational approaches, software tools, and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time-lapse microscopy images.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.},

abstract = {Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is becoming the technique of choice for analyzing in vivo the dynamics of polymer assemblies, such as the cytoskeleton. The massive amount of data produced by this method calls for computational approaches to recover the quantities of interest; namely, the polymerization and depolymerization activities and the motions undergone by the cytoskeleton over time. Attempts toward this goal have been hampered by the limited signal-to-noise ratio of typical FSM data, by the constant appearance and disappearance of speckles due to polymer turnover, and by the presence of flow singularities characteristic of many cytoskeletal polymer assemblies. To deal with these problems, we present a particle-based method for tracking fluorescent speckles in time-lapse FSM image series, based on ideas from operational research and graph theory. Our software delivers the displacements of thousands of speckles between consecutive frames, taking into account that speckles may appear and disappear. In this article we exploit this information to recover the speckle flow field. First, the software is tested on synthetic data to validate our methods. We then apply it to mapping filamentous actin retrograde flow at the front edge of migrating newt lung epithelial cells. Our results confirm findings from previously published kymograph analyses and manual tracking of such FSM data and illustrate the power of automated tracking for generating complete and quantitative flow measurements. Third, we analyze microtubule poleward flux in mitotic metaphase spindles assembled in Xenopus egg extracts, bringing new insight into the dynamics of microtubule assemblies in this system.},
